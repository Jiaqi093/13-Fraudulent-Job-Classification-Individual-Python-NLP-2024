* Project Background
This project involves a comprehensive study of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, applied to the classification of job postings. Using a dataset from Kaggle, which contains approximately 18,000 job listings (with around 800 labeled as fraudulent), the project explores how different text classification methods can identify characteristics such as required educational level and potential fraud. The aim is to provide insights into how ML/DL and NLP can improve document classification for real-world applications, especially in identifying fraudulent postings and analyzing job requirements.

* Project Tasks
The assignment is divided into several key tasks:

Dataset Analysis: Analyze the structure and linguistic features of job postings to understand their characteristics, particularly focusing on differences across classifications (e.g., real vs. fake postings).

Text Classification with Logistic Regression: Implement two classifiers using logistic regression:

Educational Level Prediction: Predict the educational requirement of job postings.
Fraud Detection: Identify fraudulent job postings.
Text Classification with Word Embeddings: Use pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec) to build logistic regression classifiers for the same tasks, comparing results with the TF-IDF approach.

Transformer-based Text Classification: Develop and train a Transformer-based classifier to further improve performance on both classification tasks.

Classification with Pre-trained Language Models: Utilize a pre-trained language model (e.g., DistilBERT) for fine-tuning and prompt-based zero-shot classification, comparing its performance with previous methods.

Reflection: Reflect on the learning process, particularly focusing on academic integrity and the role of Generative AI in coding and report writing.
